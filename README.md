# All Seeing Bot
This is a bot created by AllAwesome497 and the `repl.it discord`, which was featured in the repl.it App of the Week event.

Every message counts as one offense, unless it has one of five types of content:

1) Banned words (100% customizable, no presets)
2) Discord invite link (Option for disabling it following)
3) Hs more emojis than the server limit (Default is 30)
4) Has more mentions than allowed (Default is 5)
5) Is a spam message (Any phrase repeats x amount of times, a default of 10)

In the case it is one of those types of content, then it counts as an additional offense, that lasts for twice the duration.
Every offense expires after a set amount of time (a default of five seconds).
If a user has over a set amount of offenses (a default of five), they are muted for a set amount of time (default:5 minutes).
